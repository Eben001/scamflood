I've been noticing a lot of scam phishing sites trying to trick people into giving their Pi wallet passphrases to claim free Pi. Unfortunately, many folks are falling for it.
I thought for a second - why not fight back? So, I created these Python script that floods these scammers with endless fake passphrases to make their job a nightmare.

Right now, I’ve got three of these scripts running on a server, and they’re doing a pretty solid job.
